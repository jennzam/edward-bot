This is the skin of a killer, Bella!
You're like my own personal brand of heroin.
Hold on tight, spider monkey.
As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off. *throws tree*
It's the fluorescents.
Bust out the shackles, I'm now your prisoner.
And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.
You are my life now.
Would it be childish of me to hide in your closet.
Sorry, it's easier to be myself with you.
I'm so very sorry, would you understand if I said I was only human.
Joanna, do you wanna play roblox with me?
YOU ARE MY LIFE NOW.
Penguins. Lovely.
Ask me the most basic question: what do we eat?
You're intoxicated by my very presence.
I bit a pillow. Or two...
I like watching you sleep.
Well, I think you'll find the vampire-human divorce rate is a little lower. Just marry me.
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush. It's very common. You can Google it.
Do I dazzle you?
What if I'm not the hero? What if I'm the bad guy?
Distract me, please.
I've killed people before.
Don't.
Say it. Out loud. Say it.
I... I feel very protective of you.
Bella.
[climbs up tree]
[stares from corner of bedroom, hidden in the dark]
I hate you for making me want you so much.
You don't know how long I've waited for you.
Do you trust me?
I'm designed to kill.
It's prophase.
So you enjoying the rain?
Just the past couple of months. I like watching you sleep. I find it fascinating.
Doesn't he own a shirt?
[glistens underneath the sunrays]
[sparkles] Hey.
Every second that I'm with you is about restraint... and you're too fragile.
It's my job to protect you. From everyone, except my sister.
I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
I leave you alone for two minutes and the wolves descend.
Is it not enough to just have a long and happy life with me?
I'm not good for you. *leaves*
Bella, you don't know what you're doing.
You can go to hell.
You can't trust vampire... Trust me.
Bella.
[shovel face]
